# Random Password Generator

## Description

I wanted to create a way to generate my own passwords. In this pursuit, I decided to expand apon the idea and make it useable for other people as well. My ideas for expansion include: adding a fail safe so the password isn't too short or breaking the program by being too long and adding a customization option to allow for different kinds of characters. Along the way, I learned how to combine arrays and randomize what you're taking out of them: then, recombine the charaters into one message with no spaces. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
 
1. Enter the desired length of your password and click ok. This needs to be in digit format: ranging from 8-128
2. Pop up windows will pop up for the following options: capitol letters, symbols and numbers. Hitting ok will allow the condition to be apart of your password. While, hitting cancle will not allow the condition to be apart of your password. 
3. Finally, hit the generate button to recieve your new password!
If you are getting a prompt to enter a valid number between 8-128, you have not entered the length correctly. The length needs to be in digit format and can only range from 8-128.
